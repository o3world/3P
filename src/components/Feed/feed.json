The article in the influential <em>CPA Journal<\/em> this month is a worthwhile attempt to educate professional CPAs, whatever their position.<\/p><p>Five professors -- co-authors and colleagues at the Feliciano School of Business, Montclair State University -- explored the question, &ldquo;Are Sustainability Rankings Consistent Across Rating Agencies?&rdquo;&nbsp; One obvious element in the piece that we noticed is something happening in both the corporate sector and investment community:&nbsp; the fluid interchangeability of terms of reference.<\/p><p>Is what is being explored by the ESG ratings and rankings service providers and their investor clients performance related to &hellip;<em>CSR (corporate social responsibility)&hellip;ESG performance factors (environment\/social\/governance)&hellip;corporate sustainability&hellip;corporate citizenship&hellip;sustainable investing?&nbsp; Combinations? All of these?<\/em><br \/>The authors use the terms interchangeably, as do company managers and capital markets practitioners in discussing the ever-more important role that &ldquo;corporate sustainability rating providers&rdquo; play in investor decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>They cite the 2014 overview of rating agencies by Novethic Research (7 international rating agencies, 2 non-financial data providers, 8 specialized agencies and 20 local\/regional agencies). Several studies and books are identified as reference sources. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Specific CSR rankings examined for 2015 results:&nbsp; Newsweek&rsquo;s <em>Greenest Companies<\/em>; Forbes <em>Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations<\/em>; and, CSR Magazine <em>Top 100 Global RepTrak<\/em> companies.<br \/>We offer the perspectives of the Journal authors in our Top Story so that you can see what CPA&rsquo;s will be reading in <em>their <\/em>Journal.

None of us has the time to research every last aspect of all of the products in our lives, so certifications let us be reasonably conscious consumers despite our time crunch. Some certifications are more rigorous than others, and we can often feel overwhelmed by how many there are, but I would still call their existence a good thing.<\/p><p>Most certifications are for a thing &ndash; like produce, lumber or a building. A few are organizational certifications, as is the case for <a href=\"https:\/\/bcorporation.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">B Corps<\/a> . Two well-known examples are Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s Ice Cream and New Belgium Brewing. The B Corp certification is not saying that the ice cream or beer is certified, but rather that the organization making them is.<\/p><p>Certified for what though? This is where we pick things back up from last week. The benefit corporation status I discussed in my last blog is a legal structure that permits organizations to balance profit with positive social and environmental impacts. B Corp certification tells you that a company is actually doing that.<\/p><p>The certification is run by an organization called B Lab, which is a nonprofit that, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/bcorporation.net\/about-b-lab\" target=\"_blank\">its website<\/a>, &ldquo;serves a global movement of people using business as a force for good.&rdquo; I love it. I often say that Ray Anderson and Interface are one of the best examples that business, when done right, can be a force for good in the world.<\/p><p>Remarkably, certified B Corps now number 2,600 from 60 different countries. I recognize a lot of the listed companies, but I haven&rsquo;t heard of a majority of them. To me, that shows that they have truly tapped into a global movement, not just something that resonates here in the United States. Here is the list of companies [link to: https:\/\/bcorporation.net\/directory] if you want to browse.<\/p><p>I think this is a trend that will only accelerate, to the benefit of us all. It&rsquo;s generally good that businesses seek to be profitable. It&rsquo;s better when they are committed at a fundamental level to the triple-bottom line. When you see the B Corp logo, you know you can be pretty dang confident that the company is committed.<\/p>","linkTo3BL":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/News\/Ecocentricity-Blog-Certifiably-Certified","thumbnailLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/thumbnail\/public\/images\/EcocentricityOrangeHeader_38.jpg","mediumPhotoLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/images\/EcocentricityOrangeHeader_38.jpg"},{"companyName":"Aflac","companyLink":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/Profiles\/Aflac","id":"208061","title":"VIDEO | Paralympic Skier, Best-Selling Author, and Childhood Cancer Survivor Josh Sundquist Helps Spread the Word About My Special Aflac Duck\u2122","type":"Multimedia","publishedDate":"2018-08-07T09:55:00-04:00","shortTeaser":"Paralympic skier, best-selling author, and childhood cancer survivor Josh Sundquist understands the physical and emotional toll of facing childhood cancer.","description":"<p>Paralympic skier, best-selling author, and childhood cancer survivor&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=\"js_945\" aria-owns=\"\" data-hovercard=\"\/ajax\/hovercard\/page.php?id=85559118060&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D\" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show=\"1\" href=\"http:\/\/joshsundquist.com\" id=\"js_946\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Sundquist<\/a>&nbsp;understands the physical and emotional toll of facing childhood cancer.

Though having experience in hospitality across the country, The Venetian and The Palazzo were the first Integrated Resorts he had worked for.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I quickly learned that The Venetian and The Palazzo had many specialized departments consisting of hundreds of Team Members working intricately together to provide such a flawless guest experience,&rdquo; Han said. &ldquo;It is definitely one of our strengths, providing the best experience at this scale; we are without a doubt the best to ever do it.&rdquo;<\/p><p>With one of the company&rsquo;s top goals to deliver outstanding service to guests and clients, it is the Team Members who are equipped with the right skills and knowledge that provide those extraordinary experiences. Han noticed that majority of senior leadership came from internal promotions, which he found rewarding and encouraging to see that the company takes interest in the professional growth of Team Members.<\/p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;These types of learning and development opportunities through Sands Academy are prevalent throughout the property and it is obvious that the company takes great pride and interest in the development of our future and current leaders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At The Venetian and The Palazzo, learning never stops and everyone is deeply vested in continued professional growth, and we celebrate such accomplishments and successes throughout the year all around the property.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Han had the honor of heading a leadership development program called &ldquo;lead,&rdquo; a program for Team Members who were interested in growing with the company. This program was designed to allow Team Members to experience the daily responsibilities of a manager with the purpose of enhancing their experience to help them become the next leaders of the company. With the vision of executive leadership, the program was soon expanded to several departments. Han credits the program as an important part of identifying and developing future talents within, and has resulted in numerous promotions. The opportunity to lead the program made for a priceless experience and understanding the key to becoming a successful, effective leader.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Both personal and professional growth does not come easy, and it is such a great relief knowing that at The Venetian and The Palazzo, you do not have to do it alone,&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>He was promoted to his current position in 2016, which has provided him with the opportunity to grow further within the hospitality industry and work directly with a different department, getting to know even more Team Members. He is especially proud of his team because of their hard work and dedication.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Whether it is guiding them through their professional journey or talking to them about their personal lives and simply interacting with them as a peer-to-peer, being exposed to such a population has given me so much perspective both professionally and personally,&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>To learn more about how Las Vegas Sands supports the professional growth of its employees,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sands.com\/sands-cares\/people.html\" target=\"_blank\">visit the company website<\/a>.<\/p>","linkTo3BL":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/News\/Learning-Lead-Las-Vegas-Sands","thumbnailLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/thumbnail\/public\/images\/Sang_Han.png","mediumPhotoLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/images\/Sang_Han.png"},{"companyName":"Fair Trade USA","companyLink":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/Profiles\/Fair-Trade-USA","id":"209176","title":"6 Times Fair Trade Funds Supported Education","type":"Blog","publishedDate":"2018-08-07T09:00:00-04:00","shortTeaser":"Look at any community around the world that works with Fair Trade, from the smallest village in Uganda, to a coastal fishing town in Mexico, and you'll see that no two have the same exact set of needs.

For some of us, the fondest include leaving our families for weeks at a time to head off to summer camp.<\/p><p>Recently, Will Dickson, iHub University Innovation champion and MIT lead talent scout for General Motors, had the opportunity to do just that at the National Youth Science Camp (NYSC) in Bartow, West Virginia.<\/p><p>Each year this STEM-focused camp invites more than 120 incoming college freshman &ldquo;delegates&rdquo; from across the country and around the world to explore the vast career opportunities a STEM degree can provide. At the same time, students are given a quintessential American summer camp experience complete with 7 a.m. wake-up calls, family-style meals, outdoor activities and only handwritten letters or a landline telephone to call their parents.<\/p><p>The students are hand-picked, two from each U.S. state, by their governor&rsquo;s office and a few are chosen from other countries. Throughout the four-week experience, the students hear from experts from Silicon Valley to the East Coast and across various disciplines, from physicists to neurosurgeons to engineers of every kind. The one thing that brings the lecturers and students together is a passion for science, technology, engineering or math.<\/p><p>Here&rsquo;s what Will had to say about his experience:<\/p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><i>&ldquo;Every delegate at this camp was a &lsquo;front row&rsquo; student &ndash; these were some of the best and brightest young minds I&rsquo;ve come across. Their passion for learning, combined with their aptitude and diversity, created an incredibly unique environment for learning and having fun.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><i>My lecture focused largely on what it means to make your mark in society. I wanted them not only to walk away from the discussion with a healthy knowledge of what types of things General Motors has been working on, but to also learn why we&rsquo;re doing this work. I contextualized how everyone from me to our CEO Mary Barra contributes to our mission and impacts the world. My goal was to inspire them to find a career path that keeps them passionate and proud of their work, all while showcasing the vast career opportunities at General Motors.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>To showcase some of the latest technology out of General Motors, Will brought with him a 2018 Cadillac CT6 plug-in hybrid.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I heard a few of the students say &lsquo;Wow! I had no idea General Motors was working on technology like this,&rsquo; which made me feel great about sharing some stories about the hard work and cool technology that goes into our products,&rdquo; Will added.<\/p><p>As the U.S. currently lags other nations in its pipeline of STEM talent, General Motors is helping to reverse this trend. Like Will&rsquo;s day job working with MIT to solve industry issues and create interest in the auto industry, investing in exploratory opportunities for students, such as NYSC, is just one of the many ways General Motors is working to develop and inspire future STEM talent.<\/p><p>Key partners such as <a href=\"https:\/\/code.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Code.org<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackgirlscode.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Girls Code<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instituteofplay.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute of Play<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalpromise.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Promise<\/a> also are important to our efforts.&nbsp; Through these partnerships, we remove barriers and encourage more young people to pursue careers in technology and engineering. Our investment in STEM is also a key component in realizing our vision for a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.<\/p><p>At General Motors, a STEM hire was made every 26 minutes in 2016. As we work to transform the future of mobility, we will continue to inspire the next generation of professionals to pursue STEM&nbsp;careers through initiatives and mentorship.&nbsp;As seen with Will, we are fortunate that our employees are equally passionate in supporting our efforts to advance more than 100 STEM education initiatives around the world annually.<\/p><p>To learn more about how we are developing and inspiring future STEM talent, view our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gmsustainability.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">2017 Sustainability Report<\/a>.<\/p>","linkTo3BL":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/News\/Cabins-Campfires-and-STEM","thumbnailLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/thumbnail\/public\/images\/STEM_Camp_resized.jpg","mediumPhotoLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/images\/STEM_Camp_resized.jpg"},{"companyName":"Eastman Chemical Company","companyLink":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/Profiles\/Eastman-Chemical-Company","id":"207541","title":"Together, We Must Change the Trajectory","type":"Article","publishedDate":"2018-08-07T09:00:00-04:00","shortTeaser":"Innovation is imperative for meeting the needs of our changing world.

Climate change, population growth, security, and inequality are among the most critical challenges of our time. How will the world support the one and a half billion people predicted to be added to the global population by 2050 when we already exceed the sustainable limits of our planet? We are placing ever-increasing burdens on our resources and ecosystems. At the same time, technology is transforming the way we live and work in very positive ways&mdash;with extraordinary potential to address the needs of both businesses and society with greater efficiency and sustainability. A world where everything computes holds great promise to advance humanity on every front.<\/p><p>I am privileged to head a leading technology company at such an important and exciting time. The pace of innovation in IT is the brightest hope for solving the world&rsquo;s most pressing sustainability challenges for generations to come. The world&rsquo;s systems of manufacturing, energy production, farming, and healthcare are on the brink of an efficiency revolution&mdash;powered by connectivity and data.&nbsp;<\/p><p>We are partnering with our customers across multiple industries to transform their businesses with hybrid IT and intelligent edge solutions that are redefining efficiency and accelerating time to value. And as the industry leader in energy-efficient high-performance computing, we are empowering our customers to solve the world&rsquo;s most challenging and complex problems&mdash;from food security to healthcare delivery.<\/p><p>Although the IT industry holds incredible promise for driving sustainability in the operations of our clients, we must be always vigilant that the same focus on sustainability serves as a North Star for our own operations. High-quality data and the insights it provides are the ultimate sources of competitive advantage in the digital age; yet, extracting this business value requires an enormous amount of compute power. Unless we crack the code on delivering greater compute power with less energy, the IT sector could consume one-fifth of the world&rsquo;s electricity and produce up to 5.5% of the world&rsquo;s carbon emissions by 2025. We must develop technologies for the future with sustainability in mind&mdash;which is why HPE is committed to improving the energy performance of our product portfolio 30 times by 2025. But we can&rsquo;t stop there. We need to consider entirely new approaches to compute architecture and consumption models, while at the same time enhancing the trust, security, and governance capabilities of our customers.<\/p><p>Although HPE is at the forefront of rapid innovation, we haven&rsquo;t forgotten the values that define us. The technology sector should remember that innovation has always been confronted with ethical choices. We are proud to remain a responsible partner for our customers&mdash;to be a company that invests in its employees and sets high standards for its supply chain.<\/p><p>Environmental and social governance issues are rising to the top of boardroom agendas around the world as investors, customers, and regulators increasingly take note. Climate and human rights risks have the potential to affect every part of our value chain, including setbacks from materials scarcity and supply chain disruptions. Maintaining a resilient business means being proactive in addressing these risks before they affect customers and communities.<\/p><p>Our commitment to sustainability is increasingly important to our future as we work nonstop to shape our customers&rsquo; businesses and generate value for our shareholders. As a global company with customers around the world, our leading sustainability practices position us to have a foot forward in any market.

Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 1, humanity used more from nature than the planet&rsquo;s ecosystems are able to renew in the entire year.<\/p><p>Running out of planet is a risk. And we believe the answer is &quot;one-planet prosperity.&quot; What does this mean?<\/p><p>&quot;One planet&quot; is not a metaphor; it&#39;s a fact. It is not a goal, but a recognition of our context. Given that, the question becomes &quot;How can we best operate, considering humanity is already demanding more than Earth&rsquo;s ecosystems renew?&quot;<\/p><p>One planet is a given. The only decision is whether we want to go for prosperity or for misery.<\/p><p>While the planet is finite, human possibilities are not. Companies can succeed if we apply two of our species&rsquo; greatest strengths: foresight and innovation.<\/p><p>Earth&rsquo;s physical constraints are in sight, thanks to a suite of international agreements. Among them:<\/p><ul><li>The United Nation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenbiz.com\/tag\/sustainable-development-goals-sdgs\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Development Goals<\/a>, embraced by 197 countries, recognize the need to provide for a growing population&rsquo;s legitimate basic aspirations, while safeguarding the planet&rsquo;s health on which all our lives depend.<\/li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/sp\/targets\/\" target=\"_blank\">Aichi Biodiversity Targets<\/a>&nbsp;recognize the assault on life and enormous pressures on biodiversity.<\/li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/process-and-meetings\/the-paris-agreement\/the-paris-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">Paris Climate Accord<\/a>&nbsp;sets a clear 2 degrees Celsius warming ceiling which can be achieved with a rapid move to energy efficiency and renewable energy to reach carbon neutrality.<\/li><\/ul><p>If your company has a business strategy compatible with these 21st-century visions of thriving within the means of just one planet, you may find yourself with a baked-in economic advantage.<\/p><p><strong>Expanding market<\/strong><\/p><p>On average, companies aligned with a one-planet mindset expose themselves to an expanding market. Their products and services will be needed increasingly. Their business model inevitably will be more robust. This makes it much more likely for them to be successful in the long run than companies that are incompatible with one-planet prosperity, and which will face an inevitably shrinking demand, be limited by resources scarcity or lose its &quot;license to operate.&quot;<\/p><p>Over the past decades, sustainability strategies have given businesses a leg up, a trend that can only get stronger:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/sustainability-and-resource-productivity\/our-insights\/profits-with-purpose-how-organizing-for-sustainability-can-benefit-the-bottom-line\" target=\"_blank\">According to McKinsey<\/a>, an investment of $1 in 1993 in a value-weighted portfolio of high-sustainability companies would have grown to $22.60 by the end of 2010, compared to just $15.40 for a portfolio of &quot;low-sustainability&quot; companies.<\/p><p>We write this as leaders from the government sector (Terry from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, or SEPA), business sector (Xavier from Schneider Electric) and the not-for-profit sectors (Mathis from Global Footprint Network) because this perspective is no longer a partisan or a sectorial issue. Rather, it&rsquo;s the underlying driver of long-term business and societal success.<\/p><p>For instance, SEPA has put its entire regulatory framework under the umbrella of &quot;one planet prosperity,&quot; recognizing that while pollution regulation and control is still essential, it no longer suffices to secure the needed resource security for economic long-term success.<\/p><p>Global Footprint Network has partnered with Schneider Electric because Schneider is among the few companies who have a business case aligned with moving humanity out of ecological overshoot. It is supporting its clients to generate more value using less energy and resources, and emitting fewer greenhouse gases.<\/p><p>Indeed, Schneider Electric is driving its innovation strategy based on this insight, inventing technologies that deliver quantifiable environmental benefits to customers and their end-users. It embraces the sustainability challenge by building a business that can thrive now and in the future. Schneider explores, for instance, how solutions available now can help us move the date and return to a state of greater equilibrium with our available resources. This is the main finding of the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.schneider-electric.com\/en\/download\/document\/19982017_Mini2_Sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">recent white paper<\/a>, &quot;Living with Finite Resources: Strategies for Sustainable Resource Utilization.&quot;<\/p><p>Unfortunately, businesses that recognize this physical reality and the implications of our one-planet context for their business strategy are still rare. But we see them as critical engines for the much-needed sustainability transformation. The good news is that more companies are shifting their thinking: A recent poll of Schneider Electric clients in Europe revealed that 82 percent consider resource scarcity and sustainability as key elements in their decision-making processes.<\/p><p>When comparing current resource trends to where humanity needs to be, according to the internationally espoused visions such as the SDGs or the Paris Climate Accord, a huge performance gap becomes apparent. This illustrates that the demand for innovation and fresh approaches is dramatic.<\/p><p>Yet, working in the solution space also becomes liberating. There, we can acknowledge how far humanity still needs to go, rather than having to downplay the resource drama humanity is facing and delaying correcting action. It also becomes evident that the more who participate in building the corrective path, the easier it will be for everybody to win.<\/p><p><strong>Can we #MoveTheDate?<\/strong><\/p><p>This thinking prompted SEPA to approach its regulatory framework from the perspective of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepa.org.uk\/regulations\/how-we-regulate\/delivering-one-planet-prosperity\/\" target=\"_blank\">One Planet Prosperity<\/a>. It launched its&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepa.org.uk\/media\/219427\/one-planet-prosperity-our-regulatory-strategy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new framework (PDF)&nbsp;<\/a>in 2016, based on the belief that for 21st-century regulators, supporting the many market and societal forces that are creating radical innovation in business models, products and services is an environmental necessity.<\/p><p>The strategic thinking and business focus Schneider Electric displays or the shift SEPA has made towards its new regulatory approach, one that embraces planetary constraints as our common context, are what we want to see become the norm, not remain the exception.<\/p><p>One planet prosperity is possible: Global Footprint Network researchers teamed up with engineers from Schneider Electric to estimate what is available today to #MoveTheDate. Schneider Electric serves four key end-markets, which account for about 70 percent of the world&rsquo;s energy consumption, representing a significant opportunity to curb energy consumption and drive the global economy&rsquo;s one-planet compatibility.<\/p><p>Together, the researchers looked only at options in which Schneider Electric already is engaged: reducing energy demand as well as decarbonizing electricity generation. The researchers calculated that if 100 percent of the existing building inventory was equipped with energy efficiency, and if electricity production took advantage of renewable technology that is readily available, the world could move Earth Overshoot Day back by at least 21 days. And that&rsquo;s just for these sectors.<\/p><p>That&rsquo;s why all three of our organizations are supporting Earth Overshoot Day: We want to #MoveTheDate.

Donors simply deposit tax-deductible donations into their Modern Giving account via credit card, payroll deduction, or their bank account each paycheck, each month, or all at once. Donors decide the frequency and amount.<\/p><p>Employees can designate all or a portion of those funds to charities right away, over the course of several months when they&rsquo;ve had a chance to explore charities that match their passions, or on the spur of a moment as events arise &ndash; like disaster recovery efforts, friend&rsquo;s fundraisers, or even for their Sunday contribution at church. Moreover, employees can easily upload tax receipts from donations they&#39;ve made through other platforms into their America&#39;s Charities Modern Giving account, empowering them to keep all of their tax receipts together in one, central location, making tax time a breeze.<\/p><p>With 1.4 million IRS-registered charities in the platform, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.charities.org\/charities_list?utm_medium=3BLMedia&amp;utm_campaign=Pinkaloo&amp;utm_source=AC&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 140 high-performing charities<\/a> that comprise America&rsquo;s Charities nonprofit membership, the Modern Giving Solution is an easy, convenient, and positive employee giving experience.

Today we highlight our Volunteer of the Quarter Nick Coates, Principal ITSM Solutions Engineer, Production Engineering, in our Reading UK office.","description":"<p>Like many youth, as a 12-year-old I was curious, energetic, caring and significantly influenced by those around me. I looked up to people, especially those in the public eye. As I saw public figures at the time like Princess Diana dedicating their lives to helping others, I knew I wanted to do the same. Why couldn&rsquo;t I? And more importantly, how could I?<\/p><p>I channeled this enthusiasm and passion to become an active young volunteer, taking me to the chair of the local Youth Council, to a Member of Youth Parliament and to my surprise becoming a two-time nominee for Young Person of the Year.<\/p><p>Today I have carried this with me to my current role at Symantec, where the company&rsquo;s ethos of giving back and making the world a better, safer place makes me proud to have a professional home here. I spend an average of 10 hours per week to support a variety of different causes. For example, through the 47th Reading Scouts I am providing a balanced program to 6 to 8 year-olds, which includes camping, keeping healthy, being safe and exploring the local area. Participants work towards different activity and staged badges, along with challenge awards, as well as getting acquainted with their community libraries, police stations and more.<\/p><p>At Beale Park, we are growing and expanding the Education Centre and the Symantec Outdoor Classroom, which includes new technology from 360 cameras to virtual reality educating parents and children about local wildlife.<\/p><p>As part of Symantec&rsquo;s online safety education and STEM engagement initiatives, I lead the Symantec Cyber Spy Challenge at several national&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.teentech.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">TeenTech<\/a>&nbsp;events. The challenge takes students on an online &ldquo;treasure hunt&rdquo; working through real-life scenarios to demonstrate how information can be exposed, the role of cyber security and what a future career in the field can mean for students and the world.<\/p><p>Lastly, applying my&nbsp;security background, I am working on a first of its kind program with Thames Valley Police Neighborhood Policing Team and local schools to promote online safety. We are now working to expand the program to other communities.<\/p><p><strong>Professional skills that give back<\/strong><\/p><p>Whilst my professional skills are technical based, I have had the opportunity to grow other skills such as leadership, presentation and time management throughout my seven years at Symantec. I now have the opportunity to apply all of these to benefit my community. For example, as a School Officer I have the unique opportunity to apply my technical knowledge in a new way, while also honing my presentation and communications skills. And with the scouts I am leading smaller, more intimate teams. Additionally, it&rsquo;s enabled me to work with a diverse range of people, young and old, from all different backgrounds, genders, ages and sexual orientation; something I find invaluable to my professional work as well.<\/p><p><strong>From Royal Inspiration to Royal Recognition<\/strong><\/p><p>One of my proudest moments was being awarded The Princess Diana Memorial Award for the impact I have made to communities across the UK. This included an invitation to Buckingham Palace and the Althorp House where Princess Diana grew up.&nbsp;I was inspired by Princess Diana and was given a platform at Symantec, and both have shaped my ability to make a positive impact on the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Looking around us we can find inspiration for giving back in our daily lives &ndash; be that a mentor, a co-worker, a family member or a hero. For many in corporate roles, the platform awaits you. If it doesn&rsquo;t, create your own. Whilst not-for profits need to keep afloat through funding, they also need people to give up their time, be it one hour or 10 hours. Through volunteering, you can make a huge impact not just for the nonprofits themselves, but also the people and the environment that they touch and support. For me, this last payback keeps me wanting to give more.<\/p>","linkTo3BL":"http:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/News\/Royal-Inspiration-Royal-Recognition","thumbnailLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/thumbnail\/public\/images\/symantec1.jpg","mediumPhotoLink":"https:\/\/www.3blmedia.com\/sites\/www.3blmedia.com\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/images\/symantec1.jpg"}],"responseStatus":{"status":"success","code":"200","message":"success"}}]
